# Linear Narrative Structure:
 - This is the most straightforward structure, where events unfold in a chronological order from beginning to end.
 - Examples include many traditional novels, short stories, and straightforward movies.

# Circular Narrative Structure:
 - The story begins and ends at the same point, creating a circular or cyclical pattern.
 - This structure is often used to convey a sense of inevitability or to highlight a recurring theme.

# Episodic Narrative Structure:
 - The story is divided into episodes or loosely connected chapters, each with its own mini-arc.
